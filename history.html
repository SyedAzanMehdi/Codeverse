        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>
          JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while working at
          Netscape. Originally developed in just 10 days, it was first known as
          Mocha, then LiveScript, and finally JavaScript. It quickly became the
          language of the web, allowing developers to create interactive and
          dynamic websites. With the rise of AJAX, Node.js, and modern
          frameworks like React and Angular, JavaScript has become one of the
          most powerful and widely used programming languages in the world.
